# PokeDex (All-CSS Layout + React Hooks)

This simple application, which recreates Pokedex from the Pokemon cartoon, was built with React Hooks and all CSS layout without using any images (except for the pokemons coming from the API).
In this Pokedex the pokemon trainer will demonstrate all his knowledge about the pokemons trying to figure out what they are. You can also request tips that tell you about the skills and type of each pokemon to make the game easier.
Try as many times as you like because there are 807 pokemons.

As a data source I used the public API which can be accessed at [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co)
